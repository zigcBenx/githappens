## Getting started ðŸš€

## Installation ðŸ”¨

### Preresequisits

- install python3 (make sure to include pip in install)
- Install [glab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli)
- Authorize via glab `glab auth login` (you will need Gitlab access token, SSH recomended)
- `pip install inquirer` or `pip3 install inquirer`
- `pip install requests` or `pip3 install requests`

### Setup

- Clone repository to your local machine to whatever destination you want (just don't delete it later)

#### Setup configs

- In configs folder copy example files like so:
  `cp configs/templates.json.example configs/templates.json`
  `cp configs/config.ini.example configs/config.ini`
- In `configs.ini` you have to paste id of your group in Gitlab to `group_id` (This is for fetching milestones and epics)
- You can adjust templates now, or play with them later (however, you have to remove comments from json before running the command).

#### Alias

To run gitHappens script anywhere in filesystem, make sure to create an alias.
Add following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file
`alias gh='python3 ~/<path-to-githappens-project>/gitHappens.py'`

Run `source ~/.zshrc` or restart terminal.

## Usage âš¡

### Project selection

- Project selection is made automatically if you run script in same path as your project is located.
- You can specify project id or URL-encoded path as script argument e.g.: `--project_id=123456`
- If no of steps above happen, program will prompt you with question about project_id

#### Issue creation for multiple projects at once

This feature is useful if you have to create issue on both backend and frontend project for same thing.

- You can specify list of ids in `templates.json` file.

```
...
{
  "name": "Feature issue for API and frontend",
  ...
  "projectIds": [123, 456]
}
...
```

### Milestone selection

Milestone is set to current by default. If you want to pick it manually, pass `-m` or `--milestone` flag to the script.

### Issue templates

Issue templates are located in `configs/templates.json`.

**Make sure that names of templates are unique**

### Excluding features

If you don't want to include some settings you use following flags:

- `--no_epic` - no epic will be selected or prompted
- `--no_milestone` - no milestone will be selected or prompted

### Only issue

If you are in a hurry and want to create issue for later without merge request and branch this flag is for you.

- `--only_issue` - no merge request nor branch will be created.
  You can achive same functionality with adding onlyIssue key to `templates.json` file.

```
...
{
  "name": "Feature issue for later",
  ...
  "onlyIssue": true
}
...
```

### Open merge request in browser

You can open merge request for current checked out branch in browser with command:

```
gh open
```

### Git review

You can set default reviewers in templates.json file.

```
...
{
  "templates": [
    ...
  ],
  ...
  "reviewers": [234, 456, 678]
}
...
```

To submit merge request into review run command:

```
gh review
```

To also enable **auto-merge when the pipeline succeeds**, add the `--auto_merge` flag:

```
gh review â€“-auto_merge

gh review -am
```

### Flag help

If you run just `gh` (or whatever alias you set) or `gh --help` you will see all available flags and a short explanation.
